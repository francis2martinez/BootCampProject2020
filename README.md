# Problem and Goals
Vincent van Gogh is a legendary Dutch painter from the mid 19th century. His huge legacy includes more than 860 oil paintings characterised by bold colors and dramatic, impulsive, and expressive brushwork [Wikipedia 2020].

## Goal
Using digitalizations of Van Gogh’s paintings from the “Web Gallery of Art” (https://www.wga.hu/), create a model than can recognize if a painting is in Van Gogh’s style or not. This as a first step to eventually being able to recognize not only his style, but also if a work is a counterfeit or not.
